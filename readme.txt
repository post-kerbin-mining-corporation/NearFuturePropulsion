=================================
NEAR FUTURE PROPULSION PACK 1.3.5
=================================

This pack contains the advanced electric propulsion technologies

- Advanced Ion/Plasma Engines of many types
- Two new fuels: Lithium and ArgonGas, with various tanks available

============
DEPENDENCIES
============

Required:
- BP Part Switch (2.18.0)
- Community Resource Pack (1.4.2)
- ModuleManager (4.2.1)

Optional
- Community Tech Tree (v3.0+)

============
INSTALLATION
============

I recommend removing any previous versions of Near Future Propulsion before installing an update.

To install, place the GameData folder inside your Kerbal Space Program folder. If asked to overwrite files, do so.

I recommend the use of the Community Tech Tree (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100385-Community-Tech-Tree-1-0), which will place these engines in a set of nodes located after the stock Ion Propulsion node.
