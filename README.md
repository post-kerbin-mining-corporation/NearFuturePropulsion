## Features

A number of electric propulsion parts designed off real technology and prototypes.

* **Gridded Ion Engines:** Like the stock Dawn, they have low TWR and great Isp. They run on Xenon fuel.
* **Hall Effect Thrusters:** Similar to Gridded thrusters, but with better TWR at the cost of some Isp. They run on Argon fuel and are pretty cheap!
* **Magnetoplasmadynamic Thrusters:** With the best TWR of all electric engines, these engines are very power-hungry. They run on Lithium fuel.
* **Pulsed Inductive Thrusters:** Similar to Hall thrusters, they run on Argon fuel and have the unique ability to dump extra electricity into the engine, increasing Isp but generating more heat.
* **VASIMR Engines:** High tech and fancy, these engines run on either Xenon or Argon fuel. They can be tuned for high-thrust, low Isp operation, or low-thrust, high-Isp operation
* **Electric RCS:** Available in several flavours - a mini gridded thruster, mini Hall thruster, disposable PPT and set of small magnetoplasmadynamic thruster blocks
* **New Tanks**: More Xenon tanks and full tank sets for Argon and Lithium fuels

## Dependencies

### Required
These components are required for the mod to function and are bundled as part of any download:
* [ModuleManager (4.1.4)](https://github.com/sarbian/ModuleManager)
* [B9PartSwitch (2.18.0)](https://github.com/blowfishpro/B9PartSwitch)
* [Community Resource Pack (1.4.2)](https://github.com/BobPalmer/CommunityResourcePack)

## Installation

To install, place the GameData folder inside your Kerbal Space Program folder. If asked to overwrite files, please do so.

NOTE: Do NOT rename or move folders within the GameData folder - this mod uses absolute paths to assets and will break if this happens.

## Optional Patches

Some extra patches are bundled that you can use to tweak your installation. To install them, drop the correct folder from the **Extras** folder into your KSP GameData Folder

* **XenonHallThrusters**: Converts the Argon fuelled HETs into Xenon fuelled versions with no changes in stats (but changes in FX)

## External Mod Compatibility

This mod includes compatibility patches for the following mods:
* [KSP-AVC](https://github.com/CYBUTEK/KSPAddonVersionChecker): Provides version checking
* [Community Tech Tree](https://github.com/ChrisAdderley/CommunityTechTree): Provides an expanded, community-sourced technology tree for modders to use
* CryoTanks: installed, a new set of LH2-powered MPDT RCS thrusters are added

## Contributing

I certainly accept pull requests. Please target all such things to the `dev` branch though!
