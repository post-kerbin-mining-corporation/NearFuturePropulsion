	description = This tank was conceived when Argyle's lead engineer accidentally doubled the radius on the blueprints of the HB-8. After several dozen were built and met with critcal acclaim, it was slated for mass production. Due to regressions in plumbing technology, you may need to run a fuel line from this tank to get its "fuel" potential.
